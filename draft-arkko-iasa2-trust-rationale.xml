    <abstract>

      <t>The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as
      well, because members of the IET Administrative Oversight
      Committee (IAOC) IAOC have also served as trustees of the IETF
      Trust. A proposal for a minimal change regarding this has been
      provided separately in <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-update"/>.</t>

      <t>This companion memo provides some background on the details
      of the current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of
      the rules in the founding documents during a transition to a new
      arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as
      well <xref target="RFC4071"/> <xref target="RFC4371"/> <xref
      target="I-D.hall-iasa2-struct"/>. This is because members of the
      IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC have also
      served as trustees of the IETF Trust. A proposal for a minimal
      change regarding this has been provided separately in
      draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-update.</t>
      
      <t>This companion memo provides some background on the details
      of the current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of
      the rules in the founding documents during a transition to a new
      arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update.</t>

      <t>This memo is provided only for discussion. There is no
      intention to publish this memo as an RFC.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      
      <t>The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,
      and license certain existing and future intellectual property
      and other property used in connection with the administration of
      the IETF <xref target="RFC4371"/>. The intellectual property is,
      for instance, rights that the IETF contributors grant for text
      in RFCs and Internet Drafts. The IETF Trust also manages
      trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and ietf.org. The IETF
      Trust is also serving the broader Internet community by holding
      domains and trademarks associated with IANA <xref
      target="RFC7979"/>.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the
      Commonwealth of Virginia <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.</t>
      
      <t>Currently, the members of the IAOC are also serving as
      trustees of the IETF Trust. The founding documents specify
      persons eligible to become trustees as having to be then-current
      members of the IAOC <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.  The documents
      also specify that if for any reason there are fewer than three
      individuals serving as trustees, then the IESG, or the IESG's
      successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or
      more individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s)
      until eligible persons can be found.</t>
      
      <t>In the current system there are eight IAOC members. They are
      named by the IETF Nominations Committee or NomCom (two members),
      IESG (one member), IAB (one member), Internet Society Board of
      Trustees (one member), along with three ex-officio members via
      their roles as IETF Chair, Internet Society CEO, or IAB
      Chair. In addition, the IETF Administrative Director (IAD)
      serves also as one of the trustees.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="approach" title="General Approach">
      
      <t>There are two basic approaches to resolving the issue with
      the trustees, if the IAOC ceases to exist.  One could imagine
      merging all IETF Trust functions in the new IASA structure and
      under the planned new legal entity. This memo advocates a second
      approach where the IETF Trust is kept independent.</t>
      
      <t>The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part
      to avoid causing too much change for the IETF Trust at a time
      when the IETF administrative structure is ongoing major change.
      And, perhaps more importantly, the IETF Trust and other
      administrative IETF process are quite different. While very
      important, the IETF Trust is a very low activity entity where
      changes, if any, are minimal and gradual. There are no pressing
      issues, and the organisation serves the broader Internet
      community than perhaps the day-to-day and more IETF
      meetings-focused other parts of IASA.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="selection" title="Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected">
      
      <t>At the time the trustees served both the IETF Trust and the
      IAOC, many of the requirements for naming a particular group of
      people were driven by the IAOC's requirements.  For the IETF
      Trust in the new model, some of those arrangements can be
      rethought, both in terms of the number and source of the
      trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and length of
      terms.</t>
      
      <t>Several options are possible, of course. A newly designed
      naming process could be devised. This memo argues for relatively
      limited change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF Trust
      arrangements generally working well, and on the relatively modest
      expected time commitments combined with the need for very careful
      management of the assets.</t>
      
      <t>As a result, a smaller group of trustees appears sufficient.</t>
      
      <t>In addition, the terms for the
      trustees selected from the IETF community could be set to longer than
      the two year period typical of other IETF bodies.</t>
      
      <t>One could continue the practice of having the chairs and CEOs
      from IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be trustees as well, but
      this may not be necessary. In general, the tasks of the IETF
      Trust are well defined, and while there is a need for
      coordination, it does not need to be at the level of chairs or
      CEOs.</t>

      <t>Given all this, one approach to the appointments is to have
      trustees appointed by the Nominations Committee, IESG, and
      Internet Society Board of Trustees (or the new legal entity, but
      the Internet Society is perhaps more focused on the broad use of
      the IETF Trust assets and not merely administrative
      aspects).</t>
      
      <t>If the same principles continue to be used as are used in
      today's appointments, then appointments performed by the
      Nominations Committee need to be confirmed by another entity,
      which could be, for instance, either the IESG or the IAB.</t>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="transition" title="Transition">

      <t>When new entity for IETF administration is set
      up, at some point the IAOC will be discontinued. Fortunately,
      there's no pressing need to change all the components at the
      same time. As discussed above (<xref target="background"/>), the
      IESG holds the ability to continue to name trustees. Once the
      changes suggested in <xref target="selection"/> are in place, the
      IETF Trust will have management nominated in the usual manner,
      and the exceptional IESG process is no longer needed.</t>
