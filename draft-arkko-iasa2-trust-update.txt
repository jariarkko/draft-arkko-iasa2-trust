                   draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-update-00

Abstract

   This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust.
   Previously, Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members also
   acted as trustees.  This memo specifies that the trustees shall be
   selected separately.

   This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of
   trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are
   today.

1.  Introduction

   This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust.
   Previously, Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members also
   acted as trustees.  This memo specifies that the trustees shall be
   selected separately.

   This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of
   trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are
   today.

   For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale for
   these specific changes, see [I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-rationale].

2.  Selection of Trustees

   This document, if approved, revises the current procedures defined in
   [RFC4071] and [RFC4371] to eliminate the requirement that Trustees be
   drawn from the members of the IAOC.  Trustees shall instead be three
   members appointed by the IETF Nominations Committee and confirmed by
   the IAB, one member appointed by the IESG, and one member appointed
   by the ISOC board of Trustees.

   The IETF Trust will provide a list of desired qualifications for the
   trustee positions.

   A change to the Trust Agreement is required to effectuate this
   change, and this document request that the current Trustees make this
   change at their earliest convenience.

   The normal IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
   processes continue to apply [RFC7437].
