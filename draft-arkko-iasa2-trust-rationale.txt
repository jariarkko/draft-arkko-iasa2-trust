Discussion of the Effects of IASA 2.0 Changes as They Relate to the IETF

Abstract

   The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well,
   because members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   IAOC have also served as trustees of the IETF Trust.  A proposal for
   a minimal change regarding this has been provided separately in
   [I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-update].

   This companion memo provides some background on the details of the
   current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in
   the founding documents during a transition to a new arrangement, and
   provides a rationale for the update.

   This memo is provided only for discussion.

1.  Introduction

   The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well
   [RFC4071] [RFC4371] [I-D.hall-iasa2-struct].  This is because members
   of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC have also
   served as trustees of the IETF Trust.  A proposal for a minimal
   change regarding this has been provided separately in draft-arkko-
   iasa2-trust-update.

   This companion memo provides some background on the details of the
   current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in
   the founding documents during a transition to a new arrangement, and
   provides a rationale for the update.

   This memo is provided only for discussion.  There is no intention to
   publish this memo as an RFC.

2.  Background

   The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain, and
   license certain existing and future intellectual property and other
   property used in connection with the administration of the IETF
   [RFC4371].  The intellectual property is, for instance, rights that
   the IETF contributors grant for text in RFCs and Internet Drafts.
   The IETF Trust also manages trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and

   ietf.org.  The IETF Trust is also serving the broader Internet
   community by holding domains and trademarks associated with IANA
   [RFC7979].

   The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the Commonwealth of
   Virginia [Trust-FD].

   Currently, the members of the IAOC are also serving as trustees of
   the IETF Trust.  The founding documents specify persons eligible to
   become trustees as having to be then-current members of the IAOC
   [Trust-FD].  The documents also specify that if for any reason there
   are fewer than three individuals serving as trustees, then the IESG,
   or the IESG's successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint
   one or more individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as
   Trustee(s) until eligible persons can be found.

   In the current system there are eight IAOC members.  They are named
   by the IETF Nominations Committee or NomCom (two members), IESG (one
   member), IAB (one member), Internet Society Board of Trustees (one
   member), along with three ex-officio members via their roles as IETF
   Chair, Internet Society CEO, or IAB Chair.  In addition, the IETF
   Administrative Director (IAD) serves also as one of the trustees.

3.  General Approach

   There are two basic approaches to resolving the issue with the
   trustees, if the IAOC ceases to exist.  One could imagine merging all
   IETF Trust functions in the new IASA structure and under the planned
   new legal entity.  This memo advocates a second approach where the
   IETF Trust is kept independent.

   The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part to avoid
   causing too much change for the IETF Trust at a time when the IETF
   administrative structure is undergoing major change.  And, perhaps more
   importantly, the IETF Trust and other administrative IETF process are
   quite different.  While very important, the IETF Trust is a very low
   activity entity where changes, if any, are minimal and gradual.
   There are no pressing issues, and the organisation serves the broader
   Internet community than perhaps the day-to-day and more IETF
   meetings-focused other parts of IASA.

4.  Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected

   At the time the trustees served both the IETF Trust and the IAOC,
   many of the requirements for naming a particular group of people were
   driven by the IAOC's requirements.  For the IETF Trust in the new
   model, some of those arrangements can be rethought, both in terms of
   the number and source of the trustees, as well as the desired
   qualifications and length of terms.

   Several options are possible, of course.  A newly designed naming
   process could be devised.  This memo argues for relatively limited
   change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF Trust arrangements
   generally working well, and on the relatively modest expected time
   commitments combined with the need for very careful management of the
   assets.

   As a result, a smaller group of trustees appears sufficient.

   In addition, the terms for the trustees selected from the IETF
   community could be set to longer than the two year period typical of
   other IETF bodies.

   One could continue the practice of having the chairs and CEOs from
   IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be trustees as well, but this may not
   be necessary.  In general, the tasks of the IETF Trust are well
   defined, and while there is a need for coordination, it does not need
   to be at the level of chairs or CEOs.

5.  Transition

   When new entity for IETF administration is set up, at some point the
   IAOC will be discontinued.  Fortunately, there's no pressing need to
   change all the components at the same time.  As discussed above
   (Section 2), the IESG holds the ability to continue to name trustees.
   Once the changes suggested in Section 4 are in place, the IETF Trust
   will have management nominated in the usual manner, and the
   exceptional IESG process is no longer needed.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The author would like to thank members of the earlier IASA 2.0 design
   team, as well as Alissa Cooper, Ted Hardie, Andrew Sullivan, Brian
   Carpenter, Lucy Lynch, and John Levine for interesting discussions in
   this problem space.
