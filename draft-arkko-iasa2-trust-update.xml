    <abstract>

      <t>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
      members also acted as trustees. This memo specifies that the
      trustees shall be selected separately.</t>

      <t>This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
      members also acted as trustees. This memo specifies that the
      trustees shall be selected separately.</t>

      <t>This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today.</t>
      
      <t>For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale
      for these specific changes, see <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-rationale"/>.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="selection" title="Selection of Trustees">
      
      <t>This document, if approved, revises the current procedures
      defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/>
      to eliminate the requirement that Trustees be drawn from the
      members of the IAOC.  Trustees shall instead be three members
      appointed by the IETF Nominations Committee and confirmed by the
      IAB, one member appointed by the IESG, and one member appointed by
      the ISOC board of Trustees.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust will provide a list of desired qualifications
      for the trustee positions.</t>
      
      <t>A change to the Trust Agreement is required to effectuate
      this change, and this document request that the current Trustees
      make this change at their earliest convenience.</t>

      <t>The normal IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
      processes continue to apply <xref target="RFC7437"/>.</t>
