    <abstract>

      <t>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update of the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.</t>

      <t>This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF
      Trust. Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight 
      Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees but the IAOC 
      has been eliminated as part of an update of the structure of 
      the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA). This memo 
      specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.</t>    

      <t>This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the
      selection of trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
      remain as they are today.</t>
      
      <t>For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale
      for these specific changes, see <xref
      target="I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-rationale"/>.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="selection" title="Selection of Trustees">
      
      <t>This document revises the original Trustee selection procedures
      defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref target="RFC4371"/>, 
      to eliminate the requirement that trustees be drawn from the 
      members of the IAOC.</t>  
	    
      <t>In this newly revised IETF Trust structure, there will be five Trustees. 
      Three shall appointed by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) 
      and confirmed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), 
      one shall be appointed by the IESG, and one shall be appointed by
      the Internet Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust will provide a list of desired qualifications
      for the Trustee positions to each appointing body.</t>
      
      <t>A change to the Trust Agreement is required to effectuate
      this change, and this document requests that the current Trustees
      make this change at their earliest convenience and no later than the 
      end of the 104th IETF meeting in March 2019.</t>
      
      <t>The terms of the appointed trustees from IETF NomCom 
      shall be three years. The initial selection shall be
      one, two, and three year terms in order to initially stagger the 
      terms and thus miminize potential annual Trustee turnover. The other 
      appointments by the IESG and the ISOC Board of Trustees shall be two 
      year terms, with the initial terms being one and two years, respectively.</t>
      
      <t>IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
      processes continue to apply <xref target="RFC7437"/>.</t>
